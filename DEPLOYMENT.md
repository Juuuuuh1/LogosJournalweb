### How to Deploy

**Standard Replit Deployment Process**

1. **Click the "Deploy" button** in your Replit project
2. **Select "Autoscale Deployment"** for optimal performance
3. **Build Command**: `npm run build` (compiles React frontend + Express backend)
4. **Run Command**: `npm run start` (runs production server)
5. **Configure machine resources** (recommended: 0.25 vCPU, 1 GB RAM to start)
6. **Set maximum machines** based on expected traffic
7. **Deploy** - Replit will handle the build and deployment process

The deployment configuration is now fully working with the standard npm scripts.

### Post-Deployment
- Your app will be available at a `.replit.app` domain
- Monitor performance and logs through the Deployments dashboard
- Scale resources as needed based on usage
- Consider custom domain if desired

### Environment Requirements
- Users need their own OpenAI API key for full functionality
- PostgreSQL database connection (optional - falls back to in-memory storage)
- No additional setup required - app guides users through API key setup
- Environment variables: `NODE_ENV=production`, `DATABASE_URL` (optional)

### Cost Considerations
- Autoscale deployment scales to zero when idle (cost-effective)
- Users pay for their own OpenAI API usage
- Replit handles all hosting infrastructure
