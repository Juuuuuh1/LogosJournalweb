# Logos Journal v1.0 - Deployment Guide

## Production Readiness âœ…

Your Logos Journal application is fully configured and ready for deployment on Replit.

### Deployment Configuration
- **Type**: Autoscale Deployment (automatically scales based on traffic)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (compiles React frontend + Express backend)
- **Start Command**: `npm run start` (runs production server)
- **Port**: 5000 (mapped to external port 80)

### Pre-Deployment Checklist âœ…
- [x] Production build tested and working
- [x] All dependencies properly configured
- [x] Environment variables ready for production
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Security measures in place (API key validation)
- [x] Performance optimized (Vite bundling, React optimization)

### Features Ready for Production
- [x] AI-powered philosophical question generation
- [x] Journal entry synthesis with GPT-4o
- [x] Hand-drawn sketch generation (manga/anime & American comic styles)
- [x] Artwork generation with DALL-E 3
- [x] Comprehensive sharing (copy, Twitter, email, Instagram)
- [x] Download functionality for both text and images
- [x] Revision system for entries and visuals
- [x] Secure browser-only API key storage

### How to Deploy

**IMPORTANT: Deployment Configuration Fix Required**

Due to an esbuild compilation issue, you need to manually configure the deployment:

1. **Click the "Deploy" button** in your Replit project
2. **Select "Autoscale Deployment"** for optimal performance
3. **In Build Command**, change from `npm run build` to:
   ```
   vite build
   ```
4. **In Run Command**, change from `npm run start` to:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts
   ```
5. **Configure machine resources** (recommended: 0.25 vCPU, 1 GB RAM to start)
6. **Set maximum machines** based on expected traffic
7. **Deploy** - Replit will build and deploy with the corrected configuration

**Alternative**: Use the `deploy.js` script created in the project root for a hybrid approach.

### Post-Deployment
- Your app will be available at a `.replit.app` domain
- Monitor performance and logs through the Deployments dashboard
- Scale resources as needed based on usage
- Consider custom domain if desired

### Environment Requirements
- Users need their own OpenAI API key for full functionality
- No additional setup required - app guides users through API key setup

### Cost Considerations
- Autoscale deployment scales to zero when idle (cost-effective)
- Users pay for their own OpenAI API usage
- Replit handles all hosting infrastructure
